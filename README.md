# 🚭 SmokeLess — Local Smoking Tracker (v4)

**New in v4:**
- **Timer toasts** (in‑app notifications): “5:00 left — walk for 2 minutes?”, “2:00 left — sip water”, and start/finish toasts.
- **Custom triggers editor**: add / delete / reorder triggers; updates the Log dropdown and quick chips.
- **Professional dashboard**: subtle color‑themed backgrounds per card for better visual grouping.

Other highlights carried over:
- **3‑month plan** with daily limits and optional quit date.
- **Timer‑gated logging**, **Delay 5 min**, **badge on timer completion** (also shows ₹ saved for 1 cigarette).
- **30‑day line chart** & **hours × triggers** heatmap (last 30 days).
- **Streaks & Badges** (plus a persistent gallery).
- **Export/Import** JSON/CSV (badges included in JSON; triggers are part of settings).
- **PWA** ready; works offline when served locally.

## ▶️ Run locally
- Quick: open `index.html` directly.
- Recommended (PWA): in folder run `python -m http.server 5500` → open `http://localhost:5500/` → **Install app**.

## Tips
- Set **Cost per pack** & **Cigs per pack** in **Plan** to see savings after successful timers and in monthly money stats.
- Use the **Custom Triggers** card on the Dashboard to tailor the Log experience to your habits.
- Export JSON regularly as backup.
